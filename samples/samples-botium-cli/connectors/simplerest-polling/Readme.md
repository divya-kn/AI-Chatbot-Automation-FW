# Botium Polling HTTP/JSON example

For demo purposes, there is a chatbot included - it will respond with some random joke.

## Start Bot

First, start the chatbot endpoint:

    node jokebot.js

# Start Botium

Then, start the Botium script, sending some input to the bot, and waiting for synchronous and polling response:

    node botiumFluent.js
